## Creating Pull Requests

Contributing in this repository is based in GitHub's Pull Requests. Before creating a pull request, please read through the following rules:

- Always provide a short description to your pull request. You can also open an issue before working on it.
- Commit messages must follow a specific convention - they must be short and first letter must be uppercased, for example: `git commit -m "Added feature x"`.

## Development Setup

### Core package

First, clone the `@norther/core` package repository and install its dependencies:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/northerjs/core.git

$ cd core
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm link
```

### Project Directory

Next, you have to clone app project repository (in the parent folder oof the `core` repo):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/northerjs/norther.git

$ cd norther
$ cp .env.example .env
$ npm install
$ npm link @norther/core
```

After running these commands, run `npm start` in the `norther` directory. Your app will be available on `http://localhost:8000` by default. You can change the port in `.env` file.

To compile TypeScript code, run `npm run build:watch` command.
